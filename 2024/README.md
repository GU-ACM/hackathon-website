# 2024-hackathon-website

In this project we've come together to build a website for our club that gives information and the ability to register for our 2024 Fall Hackathon. As part of the suite of GU ACM Projects, the goal of this project is to make available the opportunity for hands-on experience in web development for club members and other Gonzaga CS students.

We are currently using HTML, CSS, and JS for our project. However as the project grows, we anticipate the technology stack to grow with it as well. The website is currently hosted on a server at our university.
